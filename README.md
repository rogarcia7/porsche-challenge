# porsche-challenge
This project was a 2-hour challenge to create a visually appealing website themed around Porsche, with only photos, videos, and a font provided. The result is a clean design showcasing Porsche's elegance and engineering, featuring embedded media and an interactive map modal. A creative challenge with limited time.
