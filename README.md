# porsche-challenge
This project was a timed challenge to create a simple yet visually appealing website in just 2 hours, with the theme centered around Porsche. The only resources provided prior to starting were a set of photos, videos, and the required font for the site.

The result is a clean design that showcases Porsche's elegance and engineering excellence, featuring embedded media and an interactive map modal.

A quick, creative challenge to deliver a professional site within a small time, demonstrating the ability to work under pressure with limited assets.
